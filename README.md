Neural Network ML to predict portfolio performance based on Uncle fundamental stock datafeed
The objective is to let the neural network predict the future stock price

Read a dataset with fundamentals on stocks: one row is one stock at a given moment in time
The data looks like this:

A neural network is defined consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer.
The network structure looks like this (Tensorflow Dashboard):


The convergence of the losses and looks like this:

Finally the network chart is this:
